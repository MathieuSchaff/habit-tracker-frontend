# Aurore — Skincare Research Memory

I was tired of switching between brand websites, copying INCI lists into a spreadsheet, then pasting them into an AI to get an opinion — and losing everything between sessions. A folder of dead Markdown notes I never opened again.

Aurore centralises that: a personal database of skincare products and ingredients, with the **decision trail** kept beside each product — why it's still a candidate, why it was rejected, what fits the user's own goals. Calm by design, no scores, no medical claims, no shopping pressure.

---

## What Aurore is

A calm skincare shelf and formula notebook for people who **compare formulas before buying** — formula-conscious buyers, INCI readers, AI-skincare overthinkers.

The core loop:

```text
collect products → understand formulas → compare candidates
→ decide (keep / wishlist / reject) → come back later without losing the reasoning
```

**Decision states** (FR labels in the UI): `Wishlist`, `En cours`, `Saint Graal`, `À éviter`. `À éviter` is a first-class state, not a trash bin — it remembers *why* a product was rejected so the same research loop doesn't repeat.

## What Aurore isn't

- Not a medical tool or diagnostic system.
- Not a universal "best product for you" oracle.
- Not a safety score or Yuka-style verdict.
- Not a shopping app or influencer platform.

## Features

**Products & ingredients**

- Personal database of cosmetic products
- INCI parsed into structured ingredients (role, family, notes)
- Tag system for filtering and auto-tagging from formula signals
- Per-product personal note + decision state
- Product comparison without winners, scores, or fake precision

**Dermo signal (algo-derm)**

- Theoretical dermatological score per product (risk / benefit / confidence axes) computed backend-side from the INCI
- Calm presentation in the UI: groups before details, no medical claims, no universal verdicts
- Algo lives in a separate repo (`algo-derm`, MIT) vendored as a tarball — see [§ Vendored `algo-derm`](#vendored-algo-derm)

**Auth**

- Email + password (Argon2 via Bun) or Google OAuth
- Short-lived access token (15 min, memory) + refresh token (7 d, HttpOnly cookie, rotated)
- Row-Level Security at the Postgres level — see [`SECURITY.md`](./docs/SECURITY.md)

## Quick start

> **Important**: the monorepo has a `shared` TypeScript package. Docker doesn't always have the build cache at startup, so build the types locally first.

```bash
# 1. First-time setup (deps + hooks + env template) — requires Bun + mise
just init

# 2. Fill in secrets
$EDITOR .env.dev

# 3. Start the full environment
just dev-fresh
```

**Daily workflow:**

- Terminal 1: `just ts-check` — TypeScript watch mode on the host
- Terminal 2: `just dev` — Docker

## Commands

### Development & types

| Command          | Description                        |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `just dev`       | Build types + start Docker         |
| `just dev-fresh` | Full cleanup + install + start     |
| `just ts-check`  | TypeScript watch mode (host)       |
| `just ts-build`  | Generate types and TanStack routes |
| `just ts-verify` | One-shot type check (host)         |
| `just diagnose`  | Check types and container state    |

### Quality & tests

| Command              | Description                    |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `just lint-fix`      | Fix style with Biome           |
| `just format`        | Format code                    |
| `just test`          | Backend tests (isolated DB)    |
| `just test-frontend` | Vitest frontend tests          |
| `just test-all`      | Full test suite                |
| `just test-db-reset` | Reset the test DB from scratch |

### Backend tests (recommended workflow)

Keep the test DB running during your session:

```bash
just test-db-up  # once per session, starts Docker on port 5433
```

Run targeted tests:

```bash
just test-dev "products"
just test-dev "features/products/tests/products.routes.test.ts"
```

Watch mode (TDD):

```bash
just test-dev-watch "products"
```

> Each test (`beforeEach`) cleans tables via `cleanDatabase` — no need to restart Docker between tests.

### E2E (Playwright)

```bash
just dev-down   # stop the dev stack first
just e2e-up     # bring up the e2e overlay (swapped DB)
just e2e        # run Playwright suites
```

### Database

| Command                             | Description                        |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `just db-generate`                  | Generate a SQL migration file      |
| `just db-migrate`                   | Apply migrations locally           |
| `just db-push`                      | Sync schema without migration      |
| `just db-studio`                    | Drizzle UI (http://localhost:4983) |
| `just db-seed`                      | Inject test data                   |
| `just db-reset`                     | Wipe + migrate + seed              |
| `just db-backup`                    | Backup to `./backups/`             |
| `just db-restore ./backups/xxx.sql` | Restore from a `.sql` file         |

## Vendored `algo-derm`

`algo-derm` is a separate MIT lib (`../algo-derm`) that computes the dermo signal from an INCI list. It's vendored into the backend as a tarball because Docker can't read outside the build context:

```bash
just vendor-algo-derm   # rebuild source, npm pack, drop into vendor/
just reinstall-backend  # if containers are running, wipe the volume + reinstall
```

Backend-only — the frontend receives the precomputed `ProductAssessment`. The bundled dataset (~535 KB) never ships to the browser.

## Configuration

- `.env.dev` — development (do not commit)
- `.env.prod` — production (do not commit)
- `.env.example` — template to copy

**Ports:**

| Service        | Port |
| :------------- | :--- |
| Frontend       | 5173 |
| API            | 3000 |
| DB             | 5432 |
| Test DB        | 5433 |
| Drizzle Studio | 4983 |

## Troubleshooting

**Editor shows errors / Docker crashes at startup**

Symptom: `Cannot find module '@habit-tracker/shared'` (legacy package name, kept for now to avoid an invasive rename across imports).

```bash
just ts-clean && just ts-build  # rebuild types
# then restart Docker
```

Make sure `just ts-check` is running in a separate terminal on the host.

**Docker issues**

```bash
just stop          # port already in use
just dev-rebuild   # after a dependency change
just clean && just dev-fresh  # nuclear reset
```

---

## Production

1. Create `.env.prod` from `.env.example`
2. Update the domain and email in `scripts/just/ops.just` (`ssl-init`)
3. `just prod-migrate` — apply migrations
4. `just prod` — start services
5. `just ssl-init` — generate SSL certificate
